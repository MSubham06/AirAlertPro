# AirAlert Pro Deployment Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the changes made to prepare the AirAlert Pro application for deployment on Vercel (frontend) and Render (backend) with your NASA and OpenAQ API keys.

## Changes Made

### 1. Environment Configuration

#### Backend (.env file)
- Created `backend/.env` with your NASA and OpenAQ API keys
- Added proper validation in `config.py` to check for missing keys
- Updated API clients to gracefully handle missing credentials

#### Frontend (.env file)
- Created `frontend/.env` with `VITE_API_URL` pointing to localhost for development
- This will need to be updated to your Render backend URL for production

### 2. Deployment Configuration

#### Vercel Configuration
- Updated `frontend/vercel.json` to include environment variables
- Created root `vercel.json` for monorepo support

#### Render Configuration
- Created `backend/README.md` with deployment instructions
- Updated `backend/runtime.txt` to specify Python version

### 3. Code Improvements

#### Backend Enhancements
- Added validation for missing API keys
- Improved error handling in API clients
- Added mock data fallbacks when APIs are unavailable
- Enhanced logging for debugging

#### Frontend Enhancements
- Updated README with deployment instructions
- Maintained existing API service structure

### 4. Utility Scripts

#### Development Scripts
- Created `setup.bat` for easy environment setup
- Created `dev.bat` for running both frontend and backend simultaneously
- Created `verify.bat` and `verify_setup.py` for environment verification

#### Deployment Scripts
- Created `DEPLOYMENT.md` with step-by-step deployment guide
- Created `DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` for systematic deployment
- Created `DEPLOYMENT_SUMMARY.md` (this file)

## Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare Your Repositories

1. Push the backend code to a GitHub repository
2. Push the frontend code to a GitHub repository (or use a monorepo approach)

### Step 2: Deploy Backend to Render

1. Sign up at [render.com](https://render.com)
2. Create a new Web Service
3. Connect your backend repository
4. Configure:
   - Build command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Start command: `gunicorn app:app`
   - Environment variables:
     - `NASA_TOKEN`: [Your NASA token]
     - `OPENAQ_API_KEY`: [Your OpenAQ API key]
5. Deploy and note the URL

### Step 3: Deploy Frontend to Vercel

1. Sign up at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Create a new project
3. Connect your frontend repository
4. Configure:
   - Framework: Vite
   - Root directory: `frontend`
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Output directory: `dist`
5. Add environment variable:
   - `VITE_API_URL`: [Your Render backend URL]
6. Deploy

### Step 4: Update Frontend Environment (if needed)

If you need to update the backend URL after initial deployment:
1. Go to your Vercel project settings
2. Navigate to Environment Variables
3. Update `VITE_API_URL` with your Render backend URL
4. Redeploy the frontend

## Testing Your Deployment

1. Visit your frontend URL
2. Check that all pages load correctly
3. Verify that data is displayed (might be mock data if APIs aren't working)
4. Test the chat functionality
5. Check the browser console for any errors

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Blank pages or 404 errors**:
   - Check Vercel deployment logs
   - Verify routing configuration

2. **API connection errors**:
   - Check Render backend logs
   - Verify environment variables are set correctly
   - Confirm API keys are valid

3. **CORS errors**:
   - Check `app.py` CORS configuration
   - Ensure your frontend domain is allowed

### Getting Help

1. Check the detailed logs in Vercel and Render dashboards
2. Refer to `DEPLOYMENT.md` for comprehensive instructions
3. Use `DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` to verify all steps
4. Run `verify.bat` to check your local environment

## Next Steps

1. Test all functionality thoroughly
2. Set up custom domains if desired
3. Configure monitoring and alerts
4. Share your deployed application

## Support

For any issues with deployment:
1. Check the repository issues
2. Review the documentation in `README.md`
3. Consult the deployment guides
4. Reach out to the platform support (Vercel/Render)

Your AirAlert Pro application is now ready for deployment with all the necessary configurations!
