# AirAlert Pro Frontend with Mock API

This document explains how to run the AirAlert Pro frontend application with mock data, making it completely self-contained and deployable without a backend.

## Overview

The frontend application has been enhanced to work with a mock API that provides realistic demo data. This allows the application to:

1. Run completely standalone without any backend
2. Display realistic air quality data for demonstration
3. Maintain all functionality including the Gemini AI chatbot
4. Be easily deployed to hosting platforms like Vercel

## Key Features

- **No Backend Required**: All data is generated by the mock API
- **Realistic Demo Data**: Air quality values, forecasts, and trends that look real
- **Full Functionality**: All pages and features work with mock data
- **Gemini AI Chatbot**: Works with your provided API key
- **Easy Deployment**: Can be deployed to Vercel with a single click

## How It Works

### 1. Mock Data Generation
The application includes a comprehensive mock data generator that creates realistic air quality data for Goa, India, including:
- Current air quality measurements
- 24-hour forecasts
- Historical trends
- Health recommendations
- Pollutant breakdowns
- Alerts and emergency notifications

### 2. API Service Wrapper
The API service automatically switches between real and mock APIs based on configuration:
- When `VITE_API_URL` contains "mock-api", mock data is used
- When running in development mode, mock data is used by default
- All API endpoints are supported with realistic mock responses

### 3. Vercel Integration
When deployed to Vercel, API requests are automatically routed to the mock API handler.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Configuration
The `.env` file is already configured for mock data:
```
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5173/mock-api
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyBtgRmkYVpxsCuSpYdYbHJATwAy82Yt1Ds
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### 3. Run Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` with mock data.

### 4. Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist` directory.

## Deployment to Vercel

### One-Click Deploy
[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/your-repo/airalert-pro&env=VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY&project-name=airalert-pro&repository-name=airalert-pro)

### Manual Deployment
1. Push your code to a GitHub repository
2. Create a new project on Vercel
3. Connect your repository
4. Set environment variables:
   - `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY`: Your Gemini API key
5. Deploy!

The application will automatically use the mock API when deployed to Vercel.

## Customization

### Modifying Mock Data
To customize the mock data:
1. Edit `src/services/mockApi.js`
2. Adjust value ranges in the generation functions
3. Modify locations in the `locations` array
4. Change AQI categories or calculation methods

### Adding New Endpoints
To add new mock endpoints:
1. Add a new method to the `MockApiService` class
2. Add the endpoint to the Vercel handler in `mock-api-handler.js`
3. Add the method to the `airQualityAPI` object in `api.js`

## Testing

### Verify Mock Data
Run the test script to verify mock data generation:
```bash
cd frontend
node test-mock-api.js
```

### Test API Endpoints
When running the development server, you can test API endpoints directly:
- `http://localhost:5173/mock-api/current`
- `http://localhost:5173/mock-api/forecast`
- `http://localhost:5173/mock-api/locations`

## Gemini AI Chatbot

The chatbot functionality works with your Gemini API key:
- All air quality data is contextualized in chat responses
- Health recommendations are based on current mock data
- The chatbot provides realistic responses about air quality

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Blank Pages**: 
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify all dependencies are installed

2. **API Errors**:
   - Ensure `VITE_API_URL` is correctly configured
   - Check that the mock API handler is working

3. **Chatbot Not Responding**:
   - Verify `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY` is set correctly
   - Check browser console for Gemini API errors

### Getting Help

1. Check the browser console for detailed error messages
2. Refer to `MOCK_API.md` for detailed documentation
3. Review the mock data generation in `src/services/mockApi.js`

## Benefits

1. **Zero Backend Dependency**: Run the complete application with just static files
2. **Easy Deployment**: Deploy to any static hosting platform
3. **Realistic Demo**: Impress users with realistic data without real APIs
4. **Development Friendly**: Work offline without internet connectivity
5. **Cost Effective**: No backend hosting costs for demos and showcases

The AirAlert Pro frontend with mock API provides a complete, professional demonstration of the application without requiring any backend infrastructure.
